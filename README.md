# # Overview

This is the first project that I"ve worked on. It was quite the learning experience but I had a lot of fun working on it.

This project had a few goals to satisy which are as follows;

- Make sure the webpage meets accessibility standards.
- Follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning using semantic HTML elements.
- Find accesible alt attributes when viewing image elements.
- Heading attributes fall into a sequential order.
- Includes a concise, descriptive title.

I made a lot of mistakes and I'm excited to look back at this a year from now and see my progress as a developer.

I couldn't figure out how to adjust the capitalization of the assets folder. I had to keep it as "Assets".
